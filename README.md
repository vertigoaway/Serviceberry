# Serviceberry
Serviceberry started as a project to improve the accuracy & coverage of geolocation databases, it does this by submitting anonyomous sensor & location data to a configured geolocation service. Serviceberry is designed to run on your mobile IOS device, while running a desktop app on either a local computer or laptop, using either Bluetooth or LAN connectivity. 

Currently, Serviceberry is only guaranteed to support [BeaconDB](https://beacondb.net/) and Linux machines. See the todo for the progress.

##  TODO

*   [ ] Add support for Bluetooth connectivity
*   [ ] Create IOS Mobile App
*   [x] Add TLS encryption
*   [ ] Build Tauri desktop app
*   [ ] Test support for other geolocation databases
